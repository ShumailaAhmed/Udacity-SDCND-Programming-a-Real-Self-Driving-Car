**Note To Readers**:  
- Please find the 8 pivotal projects leading to this 'System Integration Final Capstone' on my **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SandeepAswathnarayana/self-driving-car-engineer-nd)**.  
- For the implementation, functionality of the nodes, traffic light detector, classifier, model architecture, TensorFlow Object Detection API and more, please refer to the **[writeup.md](./writeup.md)**.  
- A comprehensive explanation and instructions on how to modify the code to build and deploy your own custom object detection model is available on my **[Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-custom-object-detector-classifier-using-tensorflow-object-detection-api-811b7bcd31c4)**.  
- Given the time constraint and my concrete schedule, I have given my best to learn and build the modules in an attempt to implent working prototypes and models. After having completed the SDC Nanodegree, I have kept my learning appetite active by: (a) working towards applying the state-of-the-art models and (b) following the works of some of the smartest minds in the field. I have only been strengthening my intuition based on Innovation ever since.  
- The projects wouldn't have been possible without the: insightful videos on concepts by the Instructors, inputs from the mentors, constant interaction with the peers/community, and my persevered efforts to overcome botttlenecks & failed attempts while implementing the code.  
- Should you have any inputs that you want to share with me (or) provide me with any relevant feedback on my projects or approach, I’d be glad to hear from you.

Overview
---
In this project, we implement a Real Self Driving Car in python to maneuver the vehicle around the track while following the traffic rules.

Goal
---
The car follows a smooth trajectory and performs its maneuvers smoothly within the advised thresholds of acceleration and jerk.
It detects traffic lights with a higher accuracy and responds to the traffic lights accordingly.

## Our Approach  

**Given below are some of my initiatives and responsibilities as the Team Lead:**
- **Logistics:** I spearheaded a team of 4, collaborating with Arun Sagar [IST], Malith P. Ranaweera [AEST], and Shuang Li [CST, China], each member coming from a diverse background and experience, in programming a real self-driving car. We worked remotely over a span of close to 3 weeks while still managing our concrete schedules in different time zones.  
- **Strategy:** By initiating the project, I was able to bring all the team members on board. I fast-tracked the project to make sure activities are worked on simultaneously in parallel instead of waiting for each assigned piece to be completed separately. By collectively deciding and giving each one of us a role with reponsibilities, we made sure we met our deadlines by splitting up our tasks into milestones. We ensured every team member chipped in when a fellow peer had a hard time getting a way around their issues, be it, setting up virtual environment, technical issues, code compiling, running tests, implementing modules, pair programming, model architecture and training, system integration, documentation.  
- **Tools & Methodology:** We predominantly used Slack for communication, project status, iteration updates, and group discussions. It goes without saying that Git Version Control proved to be a seamless transition from our local virtual machines and work spaces for implementing and incorporating each of our code.  
- **Key Takeaways:** The challenges of working on deploying a model into production. Needless to mention, we faced several bottlenecks and technical challenges throughout the course of time to have a working prototype and a successful simulation run.  
- **Project Status:** We are expecting our ROSbag files and logs to assess our code's performance on site. This has been put on hold due to uncertain times involving the COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to deploying our code into production and thereby see our code's performance on CARLA, real self-driving car in Mountain View, CA, US.  

## Autonomous Vehicle Architecture

![image alt text](imgs/Autonomous_system_architecture.png)

#### Brief Description on Autonomous Vehicle Architecture

**Sensor Subsystem**
It is a hardware component that gathers data from the environment. These hardware includes IMU, LIDAR, RADAR, Camera, GPS etc.

**Vehicle Subsystem**
It is a software component that processes data from sensors into structured information. Most of the analysis of the environment takes place here. Ex - Traffic Light Detection , Obstacle Detection, Localization etc.

**Planning Subsystem**
Once the information is processed by the perception system, Vehicle can use that information to plan its trjectory path.

**Control Subsystem**
A software component to ensure that vehicle follows the path specified by planning subsystem

## CARLA's System Architecture

The following is a system architecture diagram showing the ROS nodes and the topics used in the project. You can refer to the diagram throughout the project as needed.

*Note: The obstacle detection node is not implemented for this project as there will be no obstacles around the test track*

#### Brief Description on CARLA's System Architecture

#### Perception Subsystem
This subsystem gathers data from the environment, processes them and sends information to further subsytems. It determines the state (i.e. red, green or yellow) of the closest traffic light, the closest waypoint from the traffic light and its stop line. Afterwards, it publishes the information to <ins>/obstacle_waypoints</ins> and <ins>/traffic_waypoints</ins> topic.

**Traffic light Detection Node**

This node takes in camera images and predicts the state of traffic light. We use a deep neural net with a pretrained FCNN to predict if upcoming traffic lights are red, green or yellow.

#### Planning Subsystem

This subsystem plans the vehicle's trajectory using current position of the vehicle, the vehicle's velocity and other kinematic details. The trajectory keeps getting updated based on state of traffic lights.

For this project, the waypoints are marked as green dots to visually observe the vehicle's trajectory.

The output of this module is to pass the list of waypoints to the control subsystem.

**Waypoint Loader Node**

Waypoint Loader Node loads a CSV file that contains all the waypoints along the track and publishes them to the topic <ins>/base_waypoints</ins>

**Waypoint Updater Node**

Waypoint Updater Node subscribes to three topics; list of waypoints, the vehicle’s current position, and the state of the upcoming traffic light. Based on that the node publishes a list of waypoints to follow - each waypoint contains a position on the map and a target velocity.

#### Control Subsystem

This subsystem takes target trajectory information as input and sends control commands to navigate the vehicle.

**Waypoint Follower Node**

This node  parses the list of waypoints to follow and publishes the proposed linear and angular velocities to the /twist_cmd topic

**Drive By Wire (DBW) Node**

This node takes target linear and angular velocity and adjusts the vehicle’s controls variables accordingly (i.e. throttle, steering, brakes).
